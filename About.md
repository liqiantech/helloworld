# About

If I want to speak with someone in English, I probably need to say something about myself. So I better be prepared for this. 
It's like preparing for a speach, except I don't know when the speech will be given.

I start my career as an android developer. But my major is Industrial Design. 
And now what I am doing and looking for is front end development. That seems like somehting I need to explain.

I don't like change, but sometimes I have to change in order to find my passion and meet my destination.
