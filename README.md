# Nice to meet you, World

It's really nice to get the chance to say hello. But there probably won't be a chance to say goodbye. That's how it works. The end is unpredictable.

I find out that this is a good place for daily check in. Nothing important, just something to do as a habit. Maybe to practice English writing skills.
