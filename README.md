# Nice to meet you, World

It's nice to get the chance to say hello. But there probably won't be a chance to say goodbye. That's how it works. The end is unpredictable.

I find out that this is a good place for daily check-in. Nothing important, just something to do as a habit. Maybe to practice English writing skills.

I plan to watch a git course, but the course is a little hard and boring, so my mind keeps wandering off. When something like this happens, I tend to blame the teacher. I know this is not right. OK, back to course.

Confession: At first, I build this project out of tradition. There is nothing wrong with that. But then, I take advantage of the invisibility of this hello-world project, to commit some useless modification, to make the "GitHub commit wall" look good. I feel like cheating. So sorry. What's more "sorryable" is that I will continue this behavior. How hopeless I am. I hope this ends well. Maybe it will. Maybe it never ends.

I guess I should come up with a subject, so that it may turn out to be a whole passage, even though I only write one paragraph/sentence each day. Maybe something technique related, like the history of the computer, or how does the Internet work. Wow, that's so big. I probably won't be able to talk it through. Thinking ...

I couldn't think of anything. I want to keep this article useless. Such weird thoughts. Maybe talking to myself is a fine idea.
Recently I read the book Hongloumeng, or "Dream of the red chamber" as I remember. As people can see, the book isn't complete, such a pity. Or is it? I don't know. It makes a point at several places that things are always not perfect. Maybe it means to be not complete. After all, it's one of the best despite the incompleteness. Pursuing perfect is good, but it doesn't have to be the result. Just be grateful for what you have, or what is left.

Suddenly I realized how amazing language is. Human thoughts are very complicated, yet it can be written by words, spoken by voice. On the other hand, human thoughts can be so complicated due to language. I'm very curious about what will a man think if he doesn't have language skills. Essentially speaking is just making a specific sound, and words are used to represent this sound. After a few sentences, I already found that it's difficult to express my opinion about language since I'm not good at this language I'm using. Interesting.

Human is very small in the universe, but also a miracle, for its existence, and what human can do.

Today is very hot, 36°C! OK, maybe not exclamation hot. Hopefully, this will be the hottest day for the rest of this year. According to the weather forecast, the high temperature will be 27°C the day after tomorrow. Tomorrow will be rainy. That's it. Just talk about the weather.

Today is just like yesterday, and the day before yesterday, and the day before that. The more similar each day is the faster time flows. Maybe there is a way to live differently, but I can't find it.

I have a whole new plan for the next few years. I began my career as a developer after graduating from college, but my major was not related. Now I want to make up to it. The new plan is starting to learn computer science. This alone could take several years, but slow is better than never. I believe after this, I should know better how computers and programs work, and how the code I write day to day works behind the scene. Let's look forward to it.
