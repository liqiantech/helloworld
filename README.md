# Nice to meet you, World

It's really nice to get the chance to say hello. But there probably won't be a chance to say goodbye. That's how it works. The end is unpredictable.

I find out that this is a good place for daily check in. Nothing important, just something to do as a habit. Maybe to practice English writing skills.

I plan to watch a git course, but the course is a little hard and boring, so my mind keeps wondering off. When something like this happens, I tend to blame the teacher. I know this is not right. OK, back to course.

Confession: At first, I build this project out of tradition. There is nothing wrong with that. But then, I take advatage of the invisibility of this hello-world project, to commit some useless modification, for the purpose of making the "github commit wall" looks good. I feel like cheating. So sorry. What's more sorryable is that I will continue this behavior. How hopeless I am. I hope this ends well. Maybe it will. Maybe it never end.

I guess I should come up with a subject, so that it may turn out to be a whole passage, even though I only write one paragraph/sentence each day. Maybe somehting technique related, like the history of computer, or how does the internet work. Wow, that's so big. I probably won't be able to talk it through. Thinking ...

Couldn't think of anything. I want to keep this artile useless. Such weird thoughts. Maybe talking to myself is a fine idea.

Recently I read the book Hongloumeng, or "Dream of the red chamber" as I remember. As people can see, the book isn't complete, such a pity. Or is it? I don't know. It make a point at several place that things are always not perfect. Maybe it means to be not complete. After all, it's one of the best despite the incompleteness. Pursuing perfect is good, but it doesn't have to be the result. Just be grateful for what you have, or what is left.
