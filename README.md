# Nice to meet you, World

It's really nice to get the chance to say hello. But there probably won't be a chance to say goodbye. That's how it works. The end is unpredictable.

I find out that this is a good place for daily check in. Nothing important, just something to do as a habit. Maybe to practice English writing skills.

I plan to watch a git course, but the course is a little hard and boring, so my mind keeps wondering off. When something like this happens, I tend to blame the teacher. I know this is not right. OK, back to course.

Confession: At first, I build this project out of tradition. There is nothing wrong with that. But then, I take advatage of the invisibility of this hello-world project, to commit some useless modification, for the purpose of making the "github commit wall" looks good. I feel like cheating. So sorry. What's more sorryable is that I will continue this behavior. How hopeless I am. I hope this ends well. Maybe it will. Maybe it never end.
